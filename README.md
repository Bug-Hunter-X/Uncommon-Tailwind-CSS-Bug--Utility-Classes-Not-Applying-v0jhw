# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Utility Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a potential issue where Tailwind CSS utility classes do not apply correctly. This can occur due to various reasons, such as typos in class names, incorrect purge configurations, conflicts with other CSS, or problems within the build process. 

The `bug.js` file shows the component with the issue. The `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions and demonstrates how to fix the problem.

## Potential Causes and Solutions:

* **Typos in class names:** Double-check for any typos in your class names. Tailwind CSS is case-sensitive.
* **Missing or incorrect purge configuration:** Ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration includes the necessary purge settings to remove unused styles.  If you are using a build process like Webpack or Vite make sure to configure the proper plugins.
* **CSS conflicts:** If you're using other CSS frameworks or stylesheets, there might be conflicts. Check for specificity issues and try using the `!important` flag (use cautiously).
* **Build process issues:**  Problems with your build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Rollup) can prevent Tailwind CSS from correctly processing your styles. Review build logs and configurations.
* **Missing or incorrect `tailwind.config.js`:** Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` exists, and is correctly configured to include all necessary modules.  Ensure you are including the correct paths and content in the `content` array.
* **Incorrect import statements:**  Ensure you have correctly imported Tailwind into your application.
